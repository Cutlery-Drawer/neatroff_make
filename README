NEATROFF TOP-LEVEL MAKEFILE
===========================

This directory contains the top-level makefile of neatroff to obtain,
build and install neatroff and the helper programs that accompany it.

To use Neatroff without installing it (which is recommended), switch
to the standalone branch, which obtains the fonts automatically for
convenience, and to create Farsi documents, switch to the farsi
branch.  For more information, consult the following documents:

INSTALLATION
============

Before building the programs, edit the makefile.  GSFONTS should point
to the directory containing the standard ghostscript fonts
(ghostscript-fonts package, containing files like n021003l.afm).  In
most environments it can be either /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts or
/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts.  Also PREFIX specifies the
installation prefix.

After the installation, the following programs should be available:

* neatroff: the main troff program.
* neatpost: a postscript post-processor.
* neateqn: an eqn clone to format equations.
* neatrefer: an incompatible refer clone (see neatrefer/README).
* neatmkfn: a program to create neatroff font descriptions.
* pic9: the Plan 9 pic pre-processor.
* tbl9: the Plan 9 tbl pre-processor.
