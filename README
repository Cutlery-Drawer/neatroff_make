NEATROFF TOP-LEVEL MAKEFILE
===========================

This directory contains the top-level Makefile of Neatroff to obtain
and build Neatroff and the helper programs that accompany it.

To use Neatroff without installing it (which is recommended), execute
the following commands (which obtain a few commonly used fonts
automatically for convenience):

$ make init		# Obtain the necessary files and fonts
$ make neat		# Build the programs

To create Farsi documents, replace the first command with the
following:

$ make init_fa

The demo directory contains a sample Neatroff document:

$ cd demo		# A small neatroff test
$ make			# Generate test.pdf from test.ms

To add fonts, copy them to the fonts directory and rebuild the
neat target.  In Neatroff, fonts/MyFont.ttf can be mounted as
follows:

  .fp - R MyFont
